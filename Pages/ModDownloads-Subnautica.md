# 🐠 Normal Mods 🐟

### Alterra Sea Voyager - Uploaded on Nexus Mods
[Download page with more information](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/604)
<div>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeeTwentyThree/Lee23-SubnauticaMods/main/Downloads/Thumbnails/SeaVoyager-V2.png" width=200px>
</div>

Adds a new vehicle in the form of a boat. Being slightly larger than the cyclops, it allows you to quickly travel across planet 4546B and gives you plenty of space for building.

The Sea Voyager acts as a great alternative to a starting base. It has the same functionalities as a base would but it can move freely throughout the surface of 4546B. With the [BuildingTweaks](https://github.com/MrPurple6411/MrPurple6411-Subnautica-Mods/releases) mod by MrPurple you can even build on the deck!

Requirements:
- [SMLHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113)

This mod adds two new leviathans into the game! More information on the download page.

<div>
  <img src="https://github.com/LeeTwentyThree/Lee23-SubnauticaMods/raw/main/Downloads/Thumbnails/CustomInventoryColors.png" width=200px>
</div>

This mod adds several settings into the mod options tab related to changing the backgrounds of inventory icons.

It might seem like a small change, but I can assure it helps immensely with inventory management and organization. It looks great, too, and it's fully customizable.

If the built-in options are not enough, you have the choice to create your own custom icons by placing images into the Custom folder found within the mod.

Requirements:
- [SMLHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113)

### CustomWaterLevel - Uploaded on Nexus Mods

<div>
  <img src="https://github.com/LeeTwentyThree/Lee23-SubnauticaMods/raw/main/Downloads/Thumbnails/CustomWaterLevel.png" width=200px>
</div>

As the name implies, this mod lets you change the water level on 4546B. If you want a fun experience, I would instead recommend playing the [Below Zero version](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/255) of this mod, since it is much more challenging and has less issues!

Requirements:
- [SMLHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113)

</div>

This wonderful mod was designed by Dinofuzz, and I took the responsiblity to bring these amazing creature models to life. De-Extinction adds 15 concept art creatures into the world alongside some miscellaneous content. Among these features includes several edible fish, massive herbivores, collectible eggs, plankton, and even the Gulper Leviathan!

A necessity for all creature mods.

This is a modding library that helps modders create their own creatures with a flexible system and minimal redundant code. This mod must be installed like any other QMod for creature mods to function properly.

This mod flips the entire world upside down. There are options to flip it across other axes as well. Good luck beating the game like this, I never tried.

Whatever you say in real life happens in Subnautica. Sounds too crazy to be true? Well, sort of, because it's extremely buggy! But that's what makes it fun! This crazy mod was designed for Twitch streams, but anyone can use it. As long as you have a mic!

When installing the mod, please open the installation-README.txt file included in the download. This mod will NOT work without doing that.

- [SMLHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113)

</div>

A random event happens every 30 seconds. Maybe a Ghost Leviathan will spawn outside your base. Maybe water (bottles) will rain from the sky. Or Shrek will look down upon you from space. Yes, there is Among Us too. This mod is very dangerous, so install at your own risk.

Go watch [Socksfor1's video](https://youtu.be/j4lmTD8n4ls) on it!
