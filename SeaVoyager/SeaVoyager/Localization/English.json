    To control this vehicle, the pilot should select a speed and a movement direction. The ship will continue moving in the set direction. Pressing the off button will immediately decelerate the vessel to a halt. If you fall off of the deck of the Sea Voyager for any reason, the ship will automatically come to a stop.
    
    Additional features:
    - Two above-water docks for small submersibles.
    - Front-facing camera to assist piloting through shallow waters.
    - Sonar map to examine the local environment.
    - Global positioning system that shows the vessel's location within the region.
    - Underwater window display in the Pilot's Cab to alleviate stress levels.
    
    Please keep in mind this vehicle was not fully approved by any safety departments. As always, save often.",
