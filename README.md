# Mod lists

### [Subnautica Mod List (v2.0+)](https://github.com/LeeTwentyThree/SubnauticaMods/blob/main/Pages/ModDownloads-Subnautica.md)
- While I host mods in various places, all of my publicly released mods have been listed here.
##### Subnautica LEGACY BRANCH mod list
- Mods that are NO LONGER WORKING on current versions can be accessed [here](https://github.com/LeeTwentyThree/Lee23-LegacySubnauticaMods/blob/main/README.md).
- These mods are not compatible with any mods in this repository.

You can access this repository's unorganized releases page [here](https://github.com/LeeTwentyThree/SubnauticaMods/releases), but I do not advise looking through it yourself because it is extremely user-unfriendly. This is due to GitHub limitations.
